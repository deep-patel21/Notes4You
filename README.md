The in-built music player and HTML inline frame allow the seamless integration to Synthesia MIDI tutorials.
However, the video pulled is not always what the user is looking for!

Users can use the search functionality to automatically open a Google search with related content. This is done through a query generated as per the array index of the current track.

An exciting future implementation is connecting this software to hardware products like MIDI controller and Arduino ARGB controllers to make a teaching tool that lights up the keys to play synchronously with the video in the Notes4You application.
